# spooky-game
I was walking down the spooky alleyway. The houses were very spooky. The clouds were very spooky. The rain was very spooky. The meth addicts were very spooky. The ground was very spooky. There were spooky trees in the background. The moon was spookily lit. Life is spooky. Something about the setting really spooked me. There was a spooky abandoned orphanage. I decided to go to the orphanage because my friends dared me too and I am not dumb o non ono. The orphanage had spooky doors. Even the knobs were spooky. The windows were spookily broken. I walked through the spooky metal gateway that every orphanage has. The path was spooky and bumpy. I finally reached the spooky orphanage. I placed my hand on the spooky doorknob. I turned the spooky doorknob. I opened the spooky door. I entered the spooky abandoned orphanage. I left the spooky abandoned orphanage because I felt spooked. I received a spooky $30 from my friendos for going into the abandoned orphanage. But thenâ€¦ I went home and went to sleep.
